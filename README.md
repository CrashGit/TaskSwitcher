# TaskSwitcher
Alternative for Alt-Tab task switching.
Disclaimer: AI was used for most of the graphics-related things as I am not familiar enough with the GDI+ api.

The script is meant to be a faster means of activating open programs. It gives you a list instead of some ever-changing overview with too many images to quickly discern what you want. You can type to search through the open programs and get to what you need even faster. If there are more than 8 programs open, the window becomes scrollable. You can use your arrow keys to select different programs and Enter to activate them.

See the file for an example of how to call it or change options.
